# Running_Records
Extra practice using sql for data management class.

Problem: outdated records for EIU running.

Objective: create an easy way to kept track of EIU running information, probably put it on a website for viewing.
Will be creating a database to keep track of Top 10 in each event, hall of frame runners, and conference champs for eiu xc and track/field.

Going to be using Jetbrains tools like datagrip/webstorm.
